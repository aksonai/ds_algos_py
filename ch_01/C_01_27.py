# C-1.27 In Section 1.8, we provided three different implementations of a generator
# that computes factors of a given integer. The third of those implementa-
# tions, from page 41, was the most efÔ¨Åcient, but we noted that it did not
# yield the factors in increasing order. Modify the generator so that it reports
# factors in increasing order, while maintaining its general performance ad-
# vantages.

        if n % k == 0:
            yield k
            larger_factors.append(n // k)
        k += 1
    if k * k == n:
        yield k
    while larger_factors:
